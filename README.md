## Team - 17

## Introduction

Hi everyone! I am Aditya Srivastava. Team memeber of Team-17.

I don't know if I am the first one here, but would like to know you all :D
It'll be great if you guys add your github, linkedin whatever you guys see fit in the 
Members section down there...

Once all 6 are here we can schedule an unofficial meet call maybe?

Cheers,

Hello everyone! I am Niral Khambhati, team member of Team-17.

Yes Aditya, lets schedule a meet call after everyone is here! It would also help a lot to make a WhatsApp group as Deepika mentioned. 

I propose we play a bit of [skribbl](https://skribbl.io/) because why not :upside_down_face:

Cheers!
